Description 

*EchoCreese-Chain: A Secure Communication Protocol*

EchoCreese-Chain is a secure communication protocol that enables two parties to exchange messages securely using elliptic curve cryptography and symmetric encryption. The protocol uses a combination of public-key and symmetric-key cryptography to ensure confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the messages.

*Key Features:*

- Secure key exchange using elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) with authenticated key exchange
- Symmetric encryption using ChaCha20-Poly1305 with nonce usage
- Message authentication using HMAC with SHA-256
- Secure random number generation using `secrets` module
- Support for large messages
- Easy to use and integrate into existing applications

*Security Enhancements:*

- Authenticated key exchange to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- Nonce usage to prevent replay attacks
- Secure random number generation to prevent predictable key generation
- HMAC verification to ensure message integrity and authenticity

*Use Cases:*

- Secure communication between two parties over an insecure channel
- Protecting sensitive data in transit
- Ensuring authenticity and integrity of messages
- Complying with regulatory requirements for secure communication

*Requirements:*

- Python 3.x
- cryptography library (installed using pip)
- OpenSSL (for generating keys)

*Usage:*

1. Generate private and public keys using OpenSSL.
2. Create a peer public key file.
3. Run the EchoCreese-Chain code.
4. Verify the output.
