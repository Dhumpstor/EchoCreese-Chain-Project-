*Dependencies:*

- `cryptography` (version 3.4.0 or higher)
- `hmac` (built-in Python module)
- `hashes` (built-in Python module)
- `secrets` (built-in Python module)
- `os` (built-in Python module)

*Install Instructions:*

1. Install the `cryptography` library using pip:
```
pip install cryptography
```
1. Ensure that OpenSSL is installed on your system. You can download it from the official OpenSSL website if needed.
2. Generate private and public keys using OpenSSL:
```
openssl ecparam -name secp384r1 -genkey -noout -out private_key.pem
openssl ec -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
```
1. Create a file named `peer_public_key.pem` in the same directory as the EchoCreese-Chain code and copy the contents of the public key file (`public_key.pem`) into it.
2. Run the EchoCreese-Chain code using Python:
```
python (link unavailable)
```
Note: Make sure to replace `(link unavailable)` with the actual file name of the EchoCreese-Chain code.

*Additional Requirements:*

- Python 3.x (version 3.6 or higher recommended)
- A secure random number generator (provided by the `secrets` module)

By following these instructions, you should be able to install and run the EchoCreese-Chain code successfully.
